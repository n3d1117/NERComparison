Tim Harcourt the chief economist of the Australian Trade Commission says ABAC plays an important role by informing governments where there are problems.
" The most important thing the business groups can do is to tell the governments where there are logjams where there are obstacles where things can improve" Harcourt said.
" I think actually ABAC has played a pretty good leadership on that in talking about trade facilitation and basically making sure standards are consistent and harmonious across the region."
ABAC comprises up to three members of the private sector of each of the 21 economies that make up APEC.
It was made a permanent body in 1995 to provide an independent business perspective within APEC.
ABAC says there is a need for businesses to improve energy efficiency and to encourage conservation practices and is expected to include this in its annual report.
Harcourt of the Australian Trade Commission says the ABAC report will also discuss ways to enhance regional cooperation.
" I reckon they'll talk a little bit about customs and quarantine a little bit about having consistent security arrangements around the region" Harcourt said.
ABAC is the only non-governmental body that has an official role and formal dialogue with the leaders of the APEC economies.
It will present its annual report at the APEC leaders meeting on Saturday.
