A U.S. jury has found that drug maker Merck is not liable for the heart attack suffered by a man taking its painkiller Vioxx.
The New Jersey jurists agreed with Merck that job stress and health risks caused the 60-year old postal worker to have a heart attack four years ago.
The plaintiff argued Vioxx was responsible.
The jury also rejected the man's claim that Merck failed to properly warn users about the drug's risks.
Merck withdrew the popular drug last year after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart problems in long-term users.
Merck is facing thousands of other lawsuits over Vioxx.
In the first Merck was ordered to pay millions of dollars to the widow of a Vioxx user.
Merck is appealing that decision.
