A human rights group has accused coalition forces in Iraq of failing to secure evidence considered vital to the upcoming war crimes trial of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
Human Rights Watch in a report released Thursday said coalition forces failed to stop people from stealing thousands of Iraqi government documents in the months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The Associated Press quotes a U.S. Defense Department spokeswoman as saying it has not reviewed the report.
Saddam Hussein was arraigned in July at a U.S. military base on the outskirts of Baghdad.
Egypt's government and the World Health Organization say three Egyptian children have been hospitalized with the deadly form of avian flu.
WHO says they are receiving treatment and are in stable condition.
Egypt has had the largest number of human bird flu cases outside of Asia.
The head of the U.N. investigation into the Iraq oil-for-food program says Saddam Hussein illegally obtained more money from oil smuggling than from corruption in the U.N. program.
Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker says the smuggling began before the start of the oil-for-food program and was known to the United Nations Security Council.
In an interview with the U.S. government-funded alHurra television station Mr. Volcker said there is a lot of confusion about how much money Saddam obtained from the oil-for-food program itself.
