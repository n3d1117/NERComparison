Radical Islamic cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed has called on all Muslims to leave Europe.
In an interview with French television to be broadcast Monday Mr. Bakri says Muslims will one day return to Europe and the Islamic flag will fly over Downing Street the home of Britain's prime minister.
The interview took place in Beirut where Mr. Bakri lives after the British government stripped him of his residency in its campaign to rein in radical Islamic leaders.
Mr. Bakri triggered British outrage after the July 7 bombings in London when he said he would never tip off police if he knew a Muslim was about to carry out an attack.
