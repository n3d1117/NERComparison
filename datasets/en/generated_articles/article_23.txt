World number one men's tennis player Roger Federer has been nearly unbeatable in the past year.
The Swiss star was upset Wednesday by German Tommy Haas in the opening match of the Kooyong Classic in Melbourne.
The 41st ranked Haas fended off three break points while serving for the match and closed a 03-Jun 06-Apr 06-Apr win with an ace.
Federer said he is completely healthy and has no concerns that the ankle problem that curtailed his last season would flare up before the Australian Open which starts Monday.
The European Space Agency says it has received the first images and scientific readings from the surface of Saturn's moon Titan.

Scientists say the information from Huygens - operated jointly by the American European and Italian space agencies - may provide clues about how primitive Earth evolved into a life-bearing planet.
