Top Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia says Israeli and Palestinian mediators have agreed to prepare a document outlining their progress toward a peace accord.
In remarks to reporters Qureia said the two sides agreed during recent meetings to begin writing out their positions on all issues discussed during peace negotiations.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas resumed U.S.-brokered peace talks last November but progress has been slow.
The two sides have expressed hope at reaching a peace deal before U.S. President George Bush leaves office early next year.
But Qureia said Wednesday that reaching a peace agreement with Israel before Mr. Bush leaves office will take a" miracle."
He told reporters in the West Bank that there is still room for progress in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
The Israeli military says Major General Udi Adam - the head of the army's Northern Command - has announced his resignation.
A military statement Wednesday said General Adam has asked to leave his post" as soon as possible" and the chief of staff has accepted the request to begin the process of his replacement.
Adam was widely expected to leave the army after he was pushed aside near the end of the 34-day war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.
He was replaced by another general as" coordinator of operations in Lebanon."
