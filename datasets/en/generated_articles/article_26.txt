An Algerian man goes on trial Monday in France for terrorist attacks on the Paris subway in 1995.
Prosecutors say Rachid Ramda helped fund at least three bombings on the Paris metro.
If he is convicted Ramda could get life in prison.
The 38-year-old is already serving a 10-year sentence in France after he was convicted last year on terrorism charges.
Police say Ramda operated from London where investigators say they found evidence that he sent money to terrorists.
He is accused of helping fund attacks carried out by an Algerian militant organization the Armed Islamic Group.
British police arrested Ramda in 1995.
He fought extradition to France for 10 years.
In Monday's trial Ramda is facing charges of being an accomplice to at least three bombings on the Paris subway including the July 25 1995 attack that killed eight people and injured more than 150.
