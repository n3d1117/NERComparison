Health officials in Vietnam say a deadly strain of the bird flu virus has killed a second Vietnamese man this week raising the country's death toll from the virus to 50.
Officials say the 27-year old man from Vietnam's northern Ninh Binh province died late Thursday and tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu.
He is the third person to die from avian influenza in Vietnam this year.
Not counting the latest death the World Health Organization says 227 people around the world have died from bird flu since 2003.
Most of the world's cases 103 have occurred in Indonesia.
Witnesses in Somalia say insurgents have burned and dragged the bodies of at least two soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu after a clash between militants and Ethiopian forces killed seven people.
The violence erupted Wednesday after insurgents attacked Ethiopian tanks rolling through an insurgent stronghold near the headquarters of the former Defense Ministry in southern Mogadishu.
Ethiopia deployed soldiers to Somalia last December to help the interim government push an Islamist movement from power.
Somalia's internationally-recognized government has since been struggling to contain regular outbursts of violence by fighters loyal to the fallen Islamist movement.
The African Union has deployed troops to Somalia to replace the Ethiopian forces which Addis Ababa plans to withdraw.
